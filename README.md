# Task-2 : Unsupervised Machine Learning
### In this task, we need to cluster the Iris dataset so that we extract some idea from the data . 
The KMeans algorithm clusters the data by trying to separate samples in n groups of equal variance, minimizing a criterion known as the inertia or within-cluster sum-of-squares.
